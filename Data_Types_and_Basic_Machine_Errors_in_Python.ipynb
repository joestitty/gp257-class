    "1. It seems that with Python, the int type does not have a specfiic maximum representable value as said in the hint that \"There is no limit for the length of integer literals apart from what can be stored in available memory.\" Thus, just adding 1 to x32 and x64 does not cause them to wrap around to negative values like we see with the numpy case, where in numpy, there is a maximum representable value for the integer data types because numpy is built on C programming language and is limited to a fixed amount of memory. C is very fast and is known for its speed and effciency, so this is a bit of a trade off with the maximum rperesentable value. \n",
    "2. Given that one does not need negative values, you could use numpys 'uint32' or 'uint64' for the unsigned representations since these only hold positive values only. This is good, especially if we are working with large positive numbers since we have a larger maximum range. \n",
    "3. The main difference between adding 1 to the Numpy variable (as shown with the code below the question) and adding 1 to the Numpy array (as shown in problem 1) is that when you add 1 to the Numpy variable, it changes only the value of the new variable and does not affect the original array, whereas when you add 1 to the Numpy array it changes the value of the element in the array and the original array is affected by the operation. With this in mind, both sets of code give the logical result of overflow, which is -2147483648, which is the expected when using a 32-bit signed integer. The difference is how they handle the overflow. When you use the numpy array and then increment it by 1, numpy internally recognizes the overflow and wraps the value around to the smallest representable number for a 32-bit signed integer. In contrast, when you use the extracted numpy variable and then increment it by 1, since np_x32 is a python int, python does not have a built-in mechanism for handling integer overflow and will raise an error which I was able to observe above in my outputted code.\n",

    "#### Part A\n",
    "1. Yes, I believe this is the smallest np.float32 representation because based on the evidence of my code showing that we could not find a smaller decimal value in the negative infinity direction from the nextafter numpy function. We can see this through equations when we try to represent a 32-bit floating point equation, theres a fixed number of bits, with 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23 bits for the mantissa. Looking at the equation, $value = (-1)^{sign} * 2^{(exponent - bias)} * (1.mantissa)$, we can see that the smallest presentable subnormal float is determined by the minimum value of the mantissa and the lowest possible exponent, which is -126. This can be proved through $value = (-1)^{0} * 2^{(-126 - 127)} * (1.00000000000000000000000) = 2^{-149} * 1 = 2^{-149}$ which is approximately 1.401298464324817e-45.3\n",
    "3. Yes it does, because now when turning the array into a float32 representation, the smallest number that np.float32 can represent is controlled by the number of bits to represent the number, and if you are trying to obtain a number that is smaller than the smallest representable subnormal float in the 32-bit representration through the squaring operation, the package will not be able to represent something so small through it limited number of bits, and will show 0 as shown in my code result above. \n",
    "4. The values that cause the underflow error are values that result in 0, which in this case is for the value of 0.5. This is because when the smallest subnormal value of float 64 is multiplied by a small enough float value, the result is too small to be represented as a float32 and is rounded to 0.0. The other resulting values, 1e-45, are large enough to be represented by the system, and so those are not underflow errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Interestingly, based on my obversations, when we square mf64, the result is still a 64-bit floating point number, however, when square mf32, the result is a 64-bit float because the square of a number requires more precision as the resulting number is too large to be represented by 32-bits. This conversion from 32-bits to 64 bits is called a type promotion to increase the size of a variables data type automatically when the value it holds exceeds the range of the data type. It seems that numpy has a type promotion mechanism, and it can convert the result to 64 bits to get the full representation.\n",

    "1. I found this value by creating a function titled 'find_incorrect' that checked to see if the analytical function result and my summation function differed at a certain N value. Since we are trying to find a point of difference at a certain iteration that we don't explicitly know, we need to generate a while loop to find that point at which the difference is greater than a certain tolerance level. The difference will be a whole integer so that tolerance input will be 0. Once we find that the difference is greater, the while loop will break due to the provided if statement which is based on np.isclose which can see if the difference between two values hits a certain tolerance value. With that function, I found the difference to be at N=11590 with a difference value of 8. \n",
    "2. In order to improve the summation and correctly summ all the values to 2* Ninc, one method I could use is change the dtype to np.float64 from np.float32. The reason this should work is float64 has a higher precision than float32 and can reduce the truncation errors from rounding the last few digits and give us more accurate results. \n",
